<short>Construct a complex multivector from real multivectors.</short>
<syntax>q = complex(a,b)</syntax>
<long>
<para>
<code>complex</code> takes two multivector arguments and constructs a
complexified multivector with the first multivector as real part, and the
second as the imaginary part. The result is equivalent to
<code>a + i * b</code> (where <code>i</code> is the standard &matlab;
complex operator).
</para>
<para>
Once constructed, a complexified multivector can be separated into
complex parts or grades or into two multivectors (real and imaginary).
It is of course also possible to construct complexified multivectors by other
means, using the constructor function supplied with complex arguments.
</para>
<para>
The two arguments must be of the same size, unless one is scalar. If this
is the case the scalar argument is promoted in size to match the non-scalar
argument. (This behaviour matches the way the corresponding &matlab;
function operates.)
