% Three cases have to be handled:
%
% l is a multivector, r is not,
% r is a multivector, l is not,
% l and r are both multivectors.

% An additional complication is that the parameters may be empty (numeric,
% one only) or empty (multivector, one or both). Matlab adds empty + scalar
% to give empty: [] + 2 gives [], not 2, but raises an error (Matrix
% dimensions must agree) on attempting to add empty to an array. This
% behaviour is copied here, whether the empty parameter is a multivector or
% a numeric empty. The result is always a multivector empty. However, this
% does not apply to empty components within a multivector, which are
% treated as zero. This is to permit blades to be represented with empty
% components which are treated as zero in arithmetic operations.

el = pl == 0; % Equivalent to isempty(l), since ls must be [0,0], without
er = pr == 0; % calling an isempty function (clifford or Matlab). Note 2.

% Now check for the case where one or other argument is empty and the other
% is scalar. In this case we choose to return an empty multivector, similar
% to the behaviour of Matlab's plus function.

% Having now eliminated the cases where one parameter is empty and the
% other is scalar, the parameters must now be compatible in size, or one
% must be scalar. To permit implicit singleton expansion, we do not check
% for compatibility of size: we let Matlab's underlying functions do that.
% It could also be that they are both empty arrays of size [0, n] or [n, 0]
% etc, in which case we must return an empty array of the same size to
% match Matlab's behaviour.
