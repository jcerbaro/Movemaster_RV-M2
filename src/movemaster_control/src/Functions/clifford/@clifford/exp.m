% TODO Consider whether an explicit formula could be used in the two and
% three-dimensional cases. Beware - idempotents and nilpotents may need
% special treatment, which is not the case with the exponential series. The
% following reference gives formulae, which would need checking and testing
% against the code below:

% The method used here is a Taylor series, evaluated using Horner's rule.
% This works for any algebra.

% The exponential series coefficients are 1/factorial(k). This value is
% less than epsilon (for double precision) for k > 18. Therefore the value
% of the last coefficient compared to the first (which is unity) is less
% than epsilon. This provides a sound basis for the choice, but it requires
% that the multivector X have unit norm (since a large norm would result in
% large norms for higher powers of X). Therefore it remains to consider the
% cases where the norm of the multivector is large. TODO

N = 18;

T = e0 .* ones(size(X)); % This is for intermediate results.
Y = T;

for k = 1:N
    T = T .* (X / k);
    Y = Y + T;
end
