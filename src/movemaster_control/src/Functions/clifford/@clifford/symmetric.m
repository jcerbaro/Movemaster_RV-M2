% SYMMETRIC  Extracts the grades of a clifford multivector which do not
%            change sign under reversion.

% global clifford_descriptor;

% check_signature(m); % Redundant for now because reverse will check this.

% TODO A better algorithm here would calculate which grades are needed and
% retain just those, cf the reverse function. The code below is an initial
% hack to implement this function.

p = (m + reverse(m)) ./ 2;
