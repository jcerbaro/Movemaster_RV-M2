% This function can be computed as the left multiplication of the
% multivector m by the inverse of the pseudoscalar. (If the pseudoscalar
% squares to 0, that is it is nilpotent, there cannot be an inverse, and
% this function cannot compute a result.)

% The dual can be computed without multiplication however, since only two
% things happen: the elements of the multivector are reversed in order
% (assuming lexical order, which is how we store them), and some elements
% have a change of sign. Hence we can compute the dual without performing
% any multiplications, provided we can compute the necessary sign changes.

% Find and copy across to the result the non-empty elements of the input
% argument, at this stage preserving the input ordering.

r.multivector(ne) = m.multivector(ne);

% Now work out the signs from the index values of the non-empty elements of
% m, and the index of the pseudoscalar, and negate any elements for which
% the sign is negative.

                                                  % pseudoscalar (on the

                                                  % m (on the right).

% If the square of the pseudoscalar is negative, we need to invert the
% signs. This is because the inverse of the pseudoscalar is itself cubed.
% Instead of inverting the signs we just detect the opposite case when
% computing the indices that require negation.
