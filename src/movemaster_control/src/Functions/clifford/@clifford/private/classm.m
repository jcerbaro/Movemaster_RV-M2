r = class(m.multivector{1});

% The previous code below had too great an overhead due to the time taken
% to execute the cellfun call.

% % Even an empty multivector has empty elements, so we can deal with empty
% % multivectors by the same process.
% 
% R = cellfun(@class, m.multivector, 'UniformOutput', false);
% 
% % R is now a cell array of strings, describing the class of each component
% % of the multivector. These should all be the same, since we don't allow
% % multivectors to have components of multiple classes.
% 
% r = R{1}; % That's it apart from checking! We need to check that all
%           % components have the same class, which means all elements of R
%           % are identical.
% 
% t = strcmp(r, R); % Compare all elements of R with r.
% 
% if ~all(t)
%     error(['Error in private function classm: multivector has ' ...
%            'components of more than one class. Found ' R{~t}]);
% end
