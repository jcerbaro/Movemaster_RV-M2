function r = suppress_zeros(m)
% Private function to suppress zero components of a multivector by
% replacing them with empty. Only components which are exactly zero are
% suppressed (all elements of the component must be exact zeros).

% Notice that if all elements are now empty, this cannot be because m was
% empty on entry: we excluded that above and returned an empty multivector
% in that case.
