function B = interleave(A, N)
% Private function. Converts a matrix A which is the real representation of
% a multivector array, from a block matrix form in which each block
% contains e0, e1, e2, etc., coefficients, to a form in which each block
% contains the coefficients of one multivector. The reverse process is done
% by the function deinterleave.
