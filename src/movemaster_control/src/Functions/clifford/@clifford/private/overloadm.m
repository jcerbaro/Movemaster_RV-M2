function R = overloadm(F, Q)
% Private function to implement overloading of matrix Matlab functions.
% Called to apply the function F to the multivector array Q by operating on
% an isomorphic representation of Q. F must be a string, giving the name of
% the function F. The calling function can pass this string using
% mfilename, for simplicity of coding.
