function R = overloade(F, M, varargin)
% Private function to implement overloading of Matlab functions. Called to
% apply the function F to the clifford array M by operating on components
% of M with F. F must be a string, giving the name of the function F. The
% calling function can pass this string using mfilename, for simplicity of
% coding. varargin contains optional arguments that are not multivectors.
% Unlike overload (q.v.) this version also applies F to empty components,
% so F must work correctly with empty components.

H = str2func(F); % A handle to the function designated by F.

global clifford_descriptor

R = clifford_descriptor.empty;

% Considered using cellfun here, but the problem is that the second and
% subsequent parameters to cellfun must have the same size and shape as the
% first, and this often doesn't make sense. Therefore we seem to be stuck
% with a non-vectorised algorithm.

for i = 1:clifford_descriptor.m
    R.multivector{i} = H(M.multivector{i}, varargin{:});
