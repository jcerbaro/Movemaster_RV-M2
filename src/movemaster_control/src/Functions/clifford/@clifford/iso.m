% result in a different algebra. p and q may be omitted, in which case the
% result will be automatically converted to real, and the current algebra
% will remain unchanged. If p and q are specified, the current algebra on
% return will be Cl(p, q).

% The second and third output parameters are cell arrays of strings
% indicating the sequence of isomorphisms needed to map from the input
% algebra to the output algebra. These are intended for diagnostic use
% only.

% TODO Limitation (see note 1 at end): this code will not work for
% arbitrary choice of (p,q). Step 1 would be to detect from the parameters
% and the current algebra when a failure will occur and raise an error.
% Step 2 would be to overcome the problem and provide a solution.

% Note 1: This code will not work for all combinations of input algebra and
% target algebra. The problem is mathematical rather than programmatical,
% as exemplified by the following examples:
%
% a) Start with a 2x2 array in Cl(2,0) and map it to Cl(0,2) using this
% function. The result will be a single multivector with only 4 coefficients
% which cannot represent all the information in the original 2x2 matrix.
%
% b) Start with a single multivector in Cl(0,2) and map it to Cl(0,1). The
% result will be a 2x2 array. Map this back to Cl(0,2) and the result will
% be identical to the starting value. However, if you do the same steps but
% replace Cl(0,1) by Cl(1,0), the result will not match. This is because
% the matrix representation in Cl(1,0) has diagonal elements with the same
% value, rather than sums and differences. Information is lost when mapping
% from Cl(0,2) to Cl(1,0), unless a larger array is used.
