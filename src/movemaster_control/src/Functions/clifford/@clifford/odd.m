% TODO A better algorithm here would avoid the composition of grades using
% plus, and just copy the cells across corresponding to the odd grades. Or
% copy the entire multivector and then set the even grades to empty? A
% vectorised algorithm would construct a logical array representing the
% elements of odd grade then copy them into an empty multivector in a
% logical indexing copy.

    else
        g = grade(m, k); % Here we need to be careful, because p is not
        if ~isempty(g)   % empty, but g could be, and we must not add empty
            p = p + g;   % to non-empty.
