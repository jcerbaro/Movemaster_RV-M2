% This file exists primarily to reserve the function name 'det' for the
% purpose of computing the determinant of a matrix of multivectors. Whether
% this makes sense is not known, but in the case of quaternion matrices,
% there are multiple defined determinants (see the file of the same name in
% the Quaternion Toolbox for Matlab - qtfm.sourceforge.net).
