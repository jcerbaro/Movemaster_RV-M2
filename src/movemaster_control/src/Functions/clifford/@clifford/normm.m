% TODO A solution to the vectorisation of this function would be to define
% a Hadamard product function which computes the elementwise product within
% a multivector. The result could then be summed over all multivector
% elements. An issue is how to do the product if the elements of the
% multivector are matrices - should it be a pointwise or matrix product?

    % implicit zero (array) and skipped.

        % 23 November 2018 - error here found by Radek Tichy in Brno: the
        % sign of the squared basis element needs to be included. This
        % should then give the same result as scalar_product(m, conj(m)).
        
        % TODO A better solution would be to use m .*
        % principal_involution(m).
