% There are three cases to be handled:
%
% 1. Left and right arguments are multivectors.
% 2. The left argument is a multivector, the right is not.
% 3. The right argument is a multivector, the left is not.
%
% In fact, cases 1 and 3 can be handled by the same code. Case 2
% requires different handling.

    % The right argument is a multivector. We can handle this case by
    % forming its elementwise inverse and then multiplying. Of course,
    % if any elements have zero norm, this will result in NaNs.

    % The right argument is not a multivector, but it is numeric. We assume
    % therefore that if we divide components of the left argument by the
    % right argument, that Matlab will do the rest. However, we need to
    % avoid dividing empty elements of a by b, otherwise we will create
    % explicit zeros.
