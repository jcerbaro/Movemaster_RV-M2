% The method used here is based on isomorphism with real/complex matrices
% and the matrix logarithm. We are forced to operate on one element of
% the input array at a time because of this. Maybe a better algorithm is
% possible?

% Convert the input array to a column vector of multivectors and then to an
% isomorphic block matrix of reals/complexes. We do it in this way and not
% by converting the multivectors one-by-one as the computation of the
% isomorphism requires switching of algebras which can be very
% time-consuming.

M = iso(reshape(X, [numel(X), 1]));
[r, c] = size(M);

N = min(r, c); % This is the size of the blocks within M.

% Now compute the matrix logarithm of each of the blocks. This could be
% done with a parfor, but the overhead may not be worth it for smaller
% algebras and arrays of multivectors.

for j = 1:N:r - N + 1
    V = j:j + N - 1;
    M(V, :) = logm(M(V, :));
end

% Compute the inverse isomorphism to convert back from real/complex blocks
% to multivectors, and reshape the result back to the size of the input
% array.
