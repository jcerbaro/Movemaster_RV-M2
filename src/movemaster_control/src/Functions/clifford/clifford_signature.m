function s = clifford_signature(p, q, r)
% CLIFFORD_SIGNATURE sets the signature (p, q, r) to be the signature of
% the current Clifford algebra and initialises data structures used
% internally such as the multiplication table. If q and/or r is omitted
% they default to zero. If called without arguments, the function outputs
% diagnostic information about the currently initialised algebra. A single
% input parameter of form [p, q] or [p, q, r] is also acceptable. If called
% with an output argument, it returns the values of p, q and r from the
% descriptor as a vector. This vector will be empty if no algebra has been
% initialised. It is not permitted to have input and output arguments at
% the same time.

% Changed with version 1.4 of the toolbox to read and write the descriptor
% from cache in two parts:
%
% (a) the fields that depend on the signature, and are thus different for
% every algebra - these are written to a cache file with name p_q_r.mat
% (e.g. 0_2_0.mat), where (p,q,r) is the signature;
%
% (b) the fields that are invariant to the signature and depend only on n =
% p + q + r - these are written to a file with name n.mat (e.g. 4.mat).
%
% The descriptor structure has the following fields:
%
%           signature: a 3-element uint16 vector containing [p, q, r]
%                   n: the sum of p, q, and r, uint16
%                   m: n^2, uint32 (maximum value 65536)
%               empty: empty clifford multivector of signature (p,q,r)
%                sign: m-by-m matrix of int8               #
%         index_table: an n-element uint16 vector         *
% reverse_index_table: ditto                              *
%       index_strings: an n-element cell array of strings *
%         grade_table: n+1-by-m logical                   *
%               index: n-by-n matrix of uint16            *#
%
% * denotes invariant to the signature, but dependent on n, and therefore
% loaded/saved separately, and # denotes that for algebras with n > 10 this
% field is an empty array - dynamic computation is used to avoid a heavy
% memory use and a large cache file.
%
% The sign and index tables are in lexical order, the same order in which
% coefficients of a multivector are stored. The index_strings are in the
% same order. The index values are 1-based and ready for use. Since large
% algebras use dynamic index computation, the 16-bit limitation in the
% index in the descriptor does not apply to the larger algebras.

% From version 1.6 of the toolbox, the sign and index values are computed
% on-the-fly in the two multiplication methods, using clifford_index.m, for
% large algebras (n > 10). This saves a large amount of memory for large
% algebras and reduces the size of the cache files. This change
% necessitated a change to cache format v2.
