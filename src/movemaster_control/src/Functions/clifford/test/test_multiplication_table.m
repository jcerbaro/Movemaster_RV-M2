function test_multiplication_table(debug)
% Test code for the clifford multiplication table. The debug parameter
% controls output of progress information. This code is slow. An exhaustive
% test is done for algebras with n <= 10. For larger algebras a selection
% of tests are done, rather than an exhaustive test.

% The method used here is to test the products of combinations of basis
% elements using character string manipulation as the reference case (the
% fundamental definition of multiplication of basis blades). For example,
% e12 * e13 = - e23. The result can be computed by concatenating the
% indices 12 and 13 to make 1213, then permuting and sign changing to
% obtain -1123, then replacing 11 with the sign of e1^2. The sign of the
% basis element squared must be taken into account, of course.
